### Documentation and Support
The documentation can be found at 'Docs/Node Editor Documentation.pdf'. If you spot any mistakes, inconsistencies, or improveable sections in the documentation, please contact [Seneral](http://forum.unity3d.com/members/seneral.638015/). You can also contact him for any type of question regarding the framework, or post on the [project thread](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/simple-node-editor.189230/#post-2134738).

### Community and Contributing
I encourage anyone in the Community willing to contribute to step up and do so! There are plenty of things to do, with everything from easy to hard, which can be browsed [here](https://github.com/Baste-RainGames/Node_Editor/issues). In most cases it might help to contact the main developer [Seneral](http://forum.unity3d.com/members/seneral.638015/) when you have any questions regarding the framework itself or any of the plans linked above.
If you have any questions on how to commit, Unity made a tutorial about using git with SourceTree [here](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/cloud-build/creating-your-first-source-control-repository), and to create pull requests atlassian made one [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request/how-it-works). Don't be confused by the fact that they're using Bitucket, the same applies to GitHub. If here is an issue describing the feature or bug you implemented, you should link it from withing the pull request:)
