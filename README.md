- Extensive control over Node/Knob/Connection appearance, even individually
- Save/Load node canvas with auto save
- Fully customisable GUI and layout
- Growing runtime support
- Documentation and active support:)

### Documentation and Support
The documentation can be found in the 'Docs' folder or online [here](http://baste-raingames.github.io/Node_Editor/). It has not been updated as new focus has been put onto the develop branch and making an up-to-date documentation for it. Please contact [Seneral](http://forum.unity3d.com/members/seneral.638015/) for any type of question regarding the framework, or post on the [project thread](http://forum.unity3d.com/threads/simple-node-editor.189230/#post-2134738).

### Community and Contributing
I encourage anyone in the Community willing to contribute to step up and do so! There are plenty of things to do, with everything from easy to hard, which can be browsed [here](https://github.com/Baste-RainGames/Node_Editor/issues). In most cases it might help to contact the main developer [Seneral](http://forum.unity3d.com/members/seneral.638015/) when you have any questions regarding the framework itself or any of the plans linked above.

If you have any questions on how to commit, Unity made a tutorial about using git with SourceTree [here](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/cloud-build/creating-your-first-source-control-repository), and to create pull requests atlassian made one [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/making-a-pull-request/how-it-works). Don't be confused by the fact that they're using Bitucket, the same applies to GitHub. If there is an issue describing the feature or bug you implemented, you should link it from withing the pull request:)

### Develop Branch
Until I find time to merge the Develop branch and it's features into the stable master branch, it'll remain the best option to take if you want an extended feature set and a more dynamic framework. There are some immense improvements so you should consider it.
